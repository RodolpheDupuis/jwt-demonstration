This project was made to demonstrate the JWT implementation to secure your Fullstack web application.

The backend tech used is Node.js with Express with the following dependencies:
- jsonwebtoken
- bcryptjs
- express
- cors
- body-parser
- cookie-parser

To start the backend server from the root, run the command:
```
node jwt-back/server.js
```
or
```
cd jwt-back
node server.js
```

The frontend tech used is Next.js with the following dependency:
- axios

To start the front app from the root, run the commands:
```
cd jwt-front
npm run dev
```

This tech was demonstrated for a guide I wrote here: https://dev.to/rodolphedupuis/securing-your-fullstack-app-authentication-authorization-with-jwt-in-nextjs-and-node-4e0o
